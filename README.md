Results for the KDD rebuttal of
"Conformal Counterfactual Inference under Hidden Confounding"

1. coverage_Y0_x_dim_1.png and coverage_Y1_x_dim_1.png show coverage results of Y(0) and Y(1) with different size of interventional data $m$.
2. interval_width_Y0_x_dim_1.png and interval_width_Y1_x_dim_1.png show interval width results of Y(0) and Y(1) with different $m$.
3. Table_5_MLP_vs_DR.png shows results comparing density estimators MLP from scikit-learn with densratio on the synthetic dataset with $n=10000$ and $m=250$.
